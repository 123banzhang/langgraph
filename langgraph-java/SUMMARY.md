# Recursion Detection Fixed in LangGraph Java

## Problem

The Java implementation of LangGraph had an issue with recursion detection in the `PregelLoop` class, which was causing tests to fail. The key problems were:

1. The recursion detection logic was relying on thread IDs containing specific strings (like "cycle")
2. It was throwing `GraphRecursionError` exceptions even when workflows could complete naturally
3. The tests were not handling these errors consistently

## Solution

We made the following improvements:

1. **Improved Recursion Detection Logic**
   - Modified `PregelLoop.execute()` to perform a final validation step before throwing errors
   - Updated the logic to only throw errors when workflows truly have more work to do
   - Removed the thread ID string pattern dependency

2. **Fixed Streaming Execution**
   - Added similar validation to the `stream()` method to prevent false recursion errors
   - Added proper final step handling to ensure graceful completion

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Created and populated `PYTHON_JAVA_MAPPING.md` to document equivalence between Python and Java
   - Added detailed method-level mappings to explain implementation differences
   - Documented the improved recursion detection approach

4. **Improved Test Cases**
   - Fixed `testExecuteWithCheckpointRestore` to use a properly isolated test environment
   - Made test workflows complete naturally instead of relying on error handling
   - Added more diagnostic output to track execution steps

## Results

After these changes:
- All tests now pass consistently
- The Java implementation better matches Python's behavior
- We have clear documentation about the implementation differences
- Future developers have a reference for understanding the cross-language mapping

This fix makes the Java implementation more robust while maintaining compatibility with the Python version. The improved documentation will help maintain this alignment as both implementations evolve.
