# Streaming

Streaming is key to building responsive applications. There are a few types of data you’ll want to stream:

1. [**Agent progress**](#agent-progress) — get updates after each node in the agent graph is executed.
2. [**LLM tokens**](#llm-tokens) — stream tokens as they are generated by the language model.
3. [**Custom updates**](#tool-updates) — emit custom data from tools during execution (e.g., "Fetched 10/100 records")

You can stream [more than one type of data](#stream-multiple-modes) at a time.
