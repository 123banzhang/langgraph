# Human-in-the-loop

!!! tip "This guide uses the new `interrupt` function."

    As of LangGraph 0.2.57, the recommended way to set breakpoints is using the [interrupt](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.interrupt) function as it significantly simplifies **human-in-the-loop** patterns. Please see the [Breakpoints](breakpoints.md) guide for more information.

    If you're looking for the previous version of this conceptual guide, which relied on static breakpoints and `NodeInterrupt` exception, it is available [here](v0-human-in-the-loop.md). 

A **human-in-the-loop** (or "on-the-loop") workflow integrates human input into automated processes, allowing for decisions, validation, or corrections at key stages. This is especially useful in **LLM-based applications**, where the underlying model may generate occasional inaccuracies. In low-error-tolerance scenarios like compliance, decision-making, or content generation, human involvement ensures reliability by enabling review, correction, or override of model outputs.


## Use cases

Key use cases for **human-in-the-loop** workflows in LLM-based applications include:

1. [**üõ†Ô∏è Reviewing tool calls**](#review-tool-calls): Humans can review, edit, or approve tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.
2. **‚úÖ Validating LLM outputs**: Humans can review, edit, or approve content generated by the LLM.
3. **üí° Providing context**: Enable the LLM to explicitly request human input for clarification or additional details or to support multi-turn conversations.

## `interrupt`

The [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] in LangGraph enables human-in-the-loop workflows by pausing the graph at a specific node, presenting information to a human, and resuming the graph with their input. This function is useful for tasks like approvals, edits, or collecting additional input. The [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] is used in conjunction with the [`Command`](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) object to resume the graph with a value provided by the human.

```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: State):
    value = interrupt(
        # Any JSON serializable value to surface to the human.
        # For example, a question or a piece of text or a set of keys in the state
        some_data
    )
    ...
    # Update the state with the human's input or route the graph based on the input.
    ...

# Run the graph and hit the breakpoint
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}
graph.invoke(some_input, config=thread_config)
    
# Resume the graph with the human's input
graph.invoke(Command(resume=value_from_human), config=thread_config)
```

Please read the [Breakpoints](breakpoints.md) guide for more information on using the `interrupt` function.

## Design Patterns

There are typically three different **actions** that you can do with a human-in-the-loop workflow:

1. **Approve or Reject**: Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. This pattern often involve **routing** the graph based on the human's input.
2. **Edit Graph State**: Pause the graph to review and edit the graph state. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information. This pattern often involves **updating** the state with the human's input.
3. **Get Input**: Explicitly request human input at a particular step in the graph. This is useful for collecting additional information or context to inform the agent's decision-making process or for supporting **multi-turn conversations**.

Below we show different design patterns that can be implemented using these **actions**.

### Approve or Reject

<figcaption>Depending on the human's approval or rejection, the graph can proceed with the action or take an alternative path.</figcaption>
</figure>

Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action.

```python

from typing import Literal
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command

def human_approval(state: State) -> Command[Literal["some_node", "another_node"]]:
    is_approved = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            # Surface the output that should be
            # reviewed and approved by the human.
            "llm_output": state["llm_output"]
        }
    )

    if is_approved:
        return Command(goto="some_node")
    else:
        return Command(goto="another_node")

# Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location
# and connect it to the relevant nodes.
graph_builder.add_node("human_approval", human_approval)
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# After running the graph and hitting the breakpoint, the graph will pause.
# Resume it with either an approval or rejection.
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}
graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=thread_config)
```

    result = interrupt(
        # Interrupt information to surface to the client.
        # Can be any JSON serializable value.
        {
            "task": "Review the output from the LLM and make any necessary edits.",
            "llm_generated_summary": state["llm_generated_summary"]
        }
    )

    # Update the state with the edited text
    return {
        "llm_generated_summary": result["edited_text"] 
    }

# Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location
# and connect it to the relevant nodes.
graph_builder.add_node("human_editing", human_editing)
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

...

# After running the graph and hitting the breakpoint, the graph will pause.
# Resume it with the edited text.
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}
graph.invoke(
    Command(resume={"edited_text": "The edited text"}), 
    config=thread_config
)
```

            "question": "Is this correct?",
            # Surface tool calls for review
            "tool_call": tool_call
        }
    )

    review_action, review_data = human_review

    # Approve the tool call and continue
    if review_action == "continue":
        return Command(goto="run_tool")

    # Modify the tool call manually and then continue
    elif review_action == "update":
        ...
        updated_msg = get_updated_msg(review_data)
        # Remember that to modify an existing message you will need
        # to pass the message with a matching ID.
        return Command(goto="run_tool", update={"messages": [updated_message]})

    # Give natural language feedback, and then pass that back to the agent
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        ...
        feedback_msg = get_feedback_msg(review_data)
        return Command(goto="call_llm", update={"messages": [feedback_msg]})
```

### Multi-turn conversation

<figure markdown="1">
![image](img/human_in_the_loop/multi-turn-conversation.png){: style="max-height:400px"}
<figcaption>A <strong>multi-turn conversation</strong> architecture where an <strong>agent</strong> and <strong>human node</strong> cycle back and forth until the agent decides to hand off the conversation to another agent or another part of the system.
</figcaption>
</figure>

A **multi-turn conversation** involves multiple back-and-forth interactions between an agent and a human, which can allow the agent to gather additional information from the human in a conversational manner.

This design pattern is useful in an LLM application consisting of [multiple agents](./multi_agent.md). One or more agents may need to carry out multi-turn conversations with a human, where the human provides input or feedback at different stages of the conversation. For simplicity, the agent implementation below is illustrated as a single node, but in reality 
it may be part of a larger graph consisting of multiple nodes and include a conditional edge.

=== "Using a human node per agent"

    In this pattern, each agent has its own human node for collecting user input. 
    This can be achieved by either naming the human nodes with unique names (e.g., "human for agent 1", "human for agent 2") or by
    using subgraphs where a subgraph contains a human node and an agent node.

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import interrupt

    def human_input(state: State):
        human_message = interrupt("human_input")
        return {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "human",
                    "content": human_message
                }
            ]
        }

    def agent(state: State):
        # Agent logic
        ...

    graph_builder.add_node("human_input", human_input)
    graph_builder.add_edge("human_input", "agent")
    graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

    # After running the graph and hitting the breakpoint, the graph will pause.
    # Resume it with the human's input.
    graph.invoke(
        Command(resume="hello!"),
        config=thread_config
    )
    ```


=== "Sharing human node across multiple agents"

    In this pattern, a single human node is used to collect user input for multiple agents. The active agent is determined from the state, so after human input is collected, the graph can route to the correct agent.

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import interrupt

    def human_node(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_2", ...]]:
        """A node for collecting user input."""
        user_input = interrupt(value="Ready for user input.")

        # Determine the **active agent** from the state, so 
        # we can route to the correct agent after collecting input.
        # For example, add a field to the state or use the last active agent.
        # or fill in `name` attribute of AI messages generated by the agents.
        active_agent = ... 

        return Command(
            update={
                "messages": [{
                    "role": "human",
                    "content": user_input,
                }]
            },
            goto=active_agent,
        )
    ```

See [how to implement multi-turn conversations](../how-tos/multi-agent-multi-turn-convo.ipynb) for a more detailed example.

### Validating human input

If you need to validate the input provided by the human within the graph itself (rather than on the client side), you can achieve this by using multiple interrupt calls within a single node.

```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: State):
    """Human node with validation."""
    question = "What is your age?"

    while True:
        answer = interrupt(question)

        # Validate answer, if the answer isn't valid ask for input again.
        if not isinstance(answer, int) or answer < 0:
            question = f"'{answer} is not a valid age. What is your age?"
            answer = None
            continue
        else:
            # If the answer is valid, we can proceed.
            break
            
    print(f"The human in the loop is {answer} years old.")
    return {
        "age": answer
    }
```

## Gotchyas

!!! warning

    Resuming from a breakpoint is **different** from traditional breakpoints or Python's `input()` function, where execution resumes from the exact point where the breakpoint was triggered or where the `input()` function was called.

A critical aspect of using `interrupt` is understanding how resuming works. When you resume execution, the graph execution starts from the **beginning** of the **graph node** where the last breakpoint was triggered.

**All** code from the beginning of the node to the **breakpoint** will be re-executed. 

### Side-effects

Place code with side effects, such as API calls, **after** the `interrupt` to avoid duplication, as these are re-triggered every time the node is resumed. 

=== "Side effects before interrupt (BAD)"

    This code will re-execute the API call another time when the node is resumed from
    the `interrupt`.

    This can be problematic if the API call is not idempotent or is just expensive.

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import interrupt

    def human_node(state: State):
        """Human node with validation."""
        api_call(...) # This code will be re-executed when the node is resumed.
        answer = interrupt(question)
    ```

=== "Side effects after interrupt (OK)"

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import interrupt

    def human_node(state: State):
        """Human node with validation."""
        
        answer = interrupt(question)
        
        api_call(answer) # OK as it's after the interrupt
    ```

=== "Side effects in a separate node (OK)"

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import interrupt

    def human_node(state: State):
        """Human node with validation."""
        
        answer = interrupt(question)
        
        return {
            "answer": answer
        }

    def api_call_node(state: State):
        api_call(...) # OK as it's in a separate node
    ```

### Subgraphs called as functions


**Subgraphs**: If you're invoking a subgraph [as a function](low_level.md#as-a-function), the **parent** graph will be re-run from the **beginning of the node** where the subgraph was invoked.

```python
def some_node(state: State):
    some_code() # <-- This code will be re-executed when the subgraph is resumed.
    # Using a subgraph as a function.
    # The subgraph has an `interrupt` call
    subgraph_result = subgraph.invoke(some_input)
    ...
```


### Using multiple interrupts

Using multiple interrupts within a **single** node can be helpful for patterns like [validating human input](#validating-human-input). However, using multiple interrupts in the same node can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

When a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task's resume list. Matching is **strictly index-based**, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is critical.

To avoid issues, refrain from dynamically changing the node's structure between executions. This includes adding, removing, or reordering interrupt calls, as such changes can result in mismatched indices. These problems often arise from unconventional patterns, such as mutating state via `Command(resume=..., update=SOME_STATE_MUTATION)` or relying on global variables to modify the node‚Äôs structure dynamically.

## Best practices

* Use the [`interrupt`](breakpoints.md#the-interrupt-function) function to set breakpoints and collect user input.
* Use [`Command`](breakpoints.md#the-command-primitive) to resume execution and control the graph state.
* Consider putting all side effects (e.g., API calls) after the `interrupt` to prevent duplication. 
* Understand [how resuming from a breakpoint works](breakpoints.md#how-does-resuming-from-a-breakpoint-work) to avoid common gotchas.
