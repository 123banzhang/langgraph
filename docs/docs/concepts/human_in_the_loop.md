# Human-in-the-loop

!!! tip "This guide uses the new `interrupt` function."

    As of LangGraph 0.2.57, the recommended way to set breakpoints is using the [interrupt](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.interrupt) function as it significantly
    simpifies **human-in-the-loop** patterns.

    If you're looking for the previous version of this conceptual guide, which relied on static breakpoints and `NodeInterrupt` exception, it is available [here](v0-human-in-the-loop.md). 

A **human-in-the-loop** (or "on-the-loop") workflow integrates human input into automated processes, allowing for decisions, validation, or corrections at key stages. This is especially useful in **LLM-based applications**, where the underlying model may generate occasional inaccuracies. In low-error-tolerance scenarios like compliance, decision-making, or content generation, human involvement ensures reliability by enabling review, correction, or override of model outputs.

## Use cases

Key use cases for **human-in-the-loop** workflows in LLM-based applications include:

1. **🛠️ [Reviewing tool calls](#reviewing-tool-calls)**: Humans can review, edit, or approve tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.
2. **✅ Validating LLM outputs**: Ensure accuracy by reviewing, editing, or approving content generated by the LLM.
3. **💡 Providing context**: Enable the LLM to explicitly request human input for clarification or additional details.
4. **🔍 Debugging**: Investigate and correct errors in the LLM's decision-making process.
 
## Interrupt & Resume

**Human-in-the-loop** works in the following manner:

1. [**Persistence**](./persistence.md): the graph state is saved after each graph step, enabling **pausing** and **resuming** execution.
2. [**Interrupting execution**](#interrupting-execution): the [`interrupt`](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.interrupt) function is used to **pause** the graph at specific points for **human input**.
3. [**Running the graph**](#run): the graph is executed until it reaches the **breakpoint**.
4. [**Resuming execution**](#resuming-execution): the [`Command`](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) primitive allows **resuming** execution based on **human input**.

> **Note:** While there are other ways to set breakpoints (e.g., static breakpoints or dynamic exceptions) and resume execution (e.g., by relying on state updates `graph.update_state`), this guide focuses on the `interrupt` function and `Command` primitive as the recommended methods.

### Interrupt

Use the [interrupt](../reference/types.md/#langgraph.types.interrupt) function to **pause** the graph at specific points to collect user input. The `interrupt` function surfaces interrupt information to the client, allowing you to collect user input, validate the graph state, or make decisions before resuming execution. The graph must be compiled with a [checkpointer](./persistence.md) so graph execution can be paused and resumed.

```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def node(state: State):
    ...
    # Pause the graph and wait for user input.
    answer = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "What is your age?",
        }
    )
    # Answer will be assigned a value when the graph resumes (see below).
    print(f"Value received from interrupt: {answer}")
    # Do something with the answer.
    ...

graph_builder.add_node("node", node)

# The checkpointer is required for the `interrupt` function to work.
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

??? warning "Graph execution resumes from the beginning of the node not the exact point of the `interrupt`"

    Execution always resumes from the **beginning** of the **graph node**, not the exact point of the `interrupt`, unlike a traditional breakpoint or Python's `input()` function. Keep the following considerations in mind when using the `interrupt` function:

    1. **Side effects**: Place side-effecting code, such as API calls, **after** the `interrupt` to avoid duplication, as these are re-triggered every time the node resumes.
    2. **Multiple interrupts**: Using multiple `interrupt` calls in a node is useful (e.g., for run-time validation), but the order and number of calls must remain consistent to prevent mismatched resume values.

### Run 

**Run the graph** and observe the `interrupt` function in action:

```python
# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

```pycon
{'__interrupt__': (
        Interrupt(
            value={'question': 'what is your age?'}, 
            resumable=True, 
            ns=['node:5df255f7-d683-1a99-b7c8-00dd534aed8e'], 
            when='during'
        ),
    )
}
```

??? note "Using with `invoke` and `ainvoke`"

    `invoke` and `ainvoke` do not return the interrupt information. To access this information, you must use the [get_state](../reference/graphs.md#langgraph.graph.graph.CompiledGraph.get_state) method to retrieve the graph state after calling `invoke` or `ainvoke`.

    ```python
    # Run the graph up to the breakpoint
    result = graph.invoke(inputs, thread_config)
    # Get the graph state to get interrupt information.
    state = graph.get_state(thread_config) 
    # Resume the graph with the user's input.
    graph.invoke(Command(resume={"age": "25"}), thread_config)
    ```

### Resume

Once you have collected user input, you can **resume** the graph execution using the [Command](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) primitive. The `Command` primitive provides several options to control and modify the graph's state during resumption:

```python
graph.invoke(Command(resume={"age": "25"}), thread_config)
```

You should see the following output printed by to the `print` function in the `node` function:

```pycon
Value received from interrupt: {'age': '25'}
```

## Resuming Execution

Execution is always resumed from the **beginning** of the **graph node** where the `interrupt` was used.

## Options for resuming execution

After an `interrupt`, graph execution can be resumed using the [Command](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) primitive. The `Command` primitive provides several options to control and modify the graph's state during resumption:

1. **Pass a value to the `interrupt`**: Provide data, such as a user's response, to the graph using `Command(resume=value)`. Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used, however, this time the `interrupt(...)` call will return the value passed in the `Command(resume=value)` instead of pausing the graph.
2. **Update the graph state**: Modify the graph state using `Command(update=update)`. Note that resumption starts from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used. Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used, but with the updated state.
3. **Navigate to another node**: Direct the graph to continue execution at a different node using `Command(goto="node_name")`.

Here’s how resumption works in practice:

```python
# Resume graph execution with the user's input.
graph.invoke(Command(resume={"age": "25"}), thread_config)
```

By leveraging `Command`, you can resume graph execution, handle user inputs, and dynamically adjust the graph's state or flow.


??? note "Using other types of breakpoints"

    The `interrupt` function was introduced to address difficulties with the older methods that necessitated updating the graph state when resuming execution. You can read more about these methods in the [low-level guide](./low_level.md#breakpoints). A [previous version of this guide](v0-human-in-the-loop.md) covers the older method of setting breakpoints using **static breakpoints** and the `NodeInterrupt` exception. 

    See [this guide](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints.ipynb) for a full walkthrough of how to add breakpoints.


## Interaction Patterns

### Approval

![](./img/human_in_the_loop/approval.png)

Sometimes we want to approve certain steps in our agent's execution. 
 
We can interrupt our agent at a [breakpoint](./low_level.md#breakpoints) prior to the step that we want to approve.

This is generally recommend for sensitive actions (e.g., using external APIs or writing to a database).
 
With persistence, we can surface the current agent state as well as the next step to a user for review and approval. 
 
If approved, the graph resumes execution from the last saved checkpoint, which is saved to the `thread`:

```python
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to approve
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["node_2"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
    
# ... Get human approval ...

# If approved, continue the graph execution from the last saved checkpoint
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

See [our guide](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints.ipynb) for a detailed how-to on doing this!

### Editing

![](./img/human_in_the_loop/edit_graph_state.png)

Sometimes we want to review and edit the agent's state. 
 
As with approval, we can interrupt our agent at a [breakpoint](./low_level.md#breakpoints) prior to the step we want to check. 
 
We can surface the current state to a user and allow the user to edit the agent state.
 
This can, for example, be used to correct the agent if it made a mistake (e.g., see the section on tool calling below).

We can edit the graph state by forking the current checkpoint, which is saved to the `thread`.

We can then proceed with the graph from our forked checkpoint as done before. 

```python
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to review
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["node_2"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
    
# Review the state, decide to edit it, and create a forked checkpoint with the new state
graph.update_state(thread, {"state": "new state"})

# Continue the graph execution from the forked checkpoint
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

See [this guide](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/edit-graph-state.ipynb) for a detailed how-to on doing this!

### Input

![](./img/human_in_the_loop/wait_for_input.png)

Sometimes we want to explicitly get human input at a particular step in the graph. 
 
We can create a graph node designated for this (e.g., `human_input` in our example diagram).
 
As with approval and editing, we can interrupt our agent at a [breakpoint](./low_level.md#breakpoints) prior to this node.
 
We can then perform a state update that includes the human input, just as we did with editing state.

But, we add one thing: 

We can use `as_node=human_input` with the state update to specify that the state update *should be treated as a node*.

The is subtle, but important: 

With editing, the user makes a decision about whether or not to edit the graph state.

With input, we explicitly define a node in our graph for collecting human input!

The state update with the human input then runs *as this node*.

```python
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to to collect human input
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["human_input"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
    
# Update the state with the user input as if it was the human_input node
graph.update_state(thread, {"user_input": user_input}, as_node="human_input")

# Continue the graph execution from the checkpoint created by the human_input node
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

See [this guide](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input.ipynb) for a detailed how-to on doing this!

## Use-cases

### Reviewing Tool Calls

Some user interaction patterns combine the concepts outlined above.

For example, many agents rely on [tool calling](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_calling/) to make decisions. Tool calling introduces unique challenges because the agent must get multiple aspects right:

1. **Selecting the correct tool**: The agent must choose the appropriate tool to call.
2. **Providing accurate arguments**: The agent must pass the correct parameters to the tool.
3. **Ensuring discretion**: Even if the tool call is technically correct, it might involve sensitive operations that require human approval.

By addressing these challenges, we can integrate **human-in-the-loop** processes to review and approve tool calls effectively.

```python
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to review the tool call from the LLM 
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["human_review"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
    
# Review the tool call and update it, if needed, as the human_review node
graph.update_state(thread, {"tool_call": "updated tool call"}, as_node="human_review")

# Otherwise, approve the tool call and proceed with the graph execution with no edits 

# Continue the graph execution from either: 
# (1) the forked checkpoint created by human_review or 
# (2) the checkpoint saved when the tool call was originally made (no edits in human_review)
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

See [the how to review tool calls guide](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/review-tool-calls.ipynb) for a details.

### Time Travel

When working with agents, we often want closely examine their decision making process: 

(1) Even when they arrive a desired final result, the reasoning that led to that result is often important to examine.

(2) When agents make mistakes, it is often valuable to understand why.

(3) In either of the above cases, it is useful to manually explore alternative decision making paths.

Collectively, we call these debugging concepts `time-travel` and they are composed of `replaying` and `forking`.

#### Replaying

![](./img/human_in_the_loop/replay.png)

Sometimes we want to simply replay past actions of an agent. 
 
Above, we showed the case of executing an agent from the current state (or checkpoint) of the graph.

We by simply passing in `None` for the input with a `thread`.

```
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

Now, we can modify this to replay past actions from a *specific* checkpoint by passing in the checkpoint ID.

To get a specific checkpoint ID, we can easily get all of the checkpoints in the thread and filter to the one we want.

```python
all_checkpoints = []
for state in app.get_state_history(thread):
    all_checkpoints.append(state)
```

Each checkpoint has a unique ID, which we can use to replay from a specific checkpoint.

Assume from reviewing the checkpoints that we want to replay from one, `xxx`.

We just pass in the checkpoint ID when we run the graph.

```python
config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xxx'}}
for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```
 
Importantly, the graph knows which checkpoints have been previously executed. 

So, it will re-play any previously executed nodes rather than re-executing them.

See [this additional conceptual guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/#replay) for related context on replaying.

See see [this guide](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel.ipynb) for a detailed how-to on doing time-travel!

#### Forking

![](./img/human_in_the_loop/forking.png)

Forking allows us to revisit an agent's past actions and explore alternative paths through the graph.

The **Editing** pattern, as described earlier, enables modifications to the *current* state of the graph. But what if you want to fork from a *past* state?

For instance, suppose you want to edit a specific checkpoint, such as `xyz`. You can achieve this by providing the relevant `checkpoint_id` when updating the graph's state.

```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "checkpoint_id": "xyz"}}
graph.update_state(config, {"state": "updated state"}, )
```

This creates a new forked checkpoint, `xyz-fork`, which we can then run the graph from.

```python
config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xyz-fork'}}
for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

See [this additional conceptual guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/#update-state) for related context on forking.

See see [this guide](../how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel.ipynb) for a detailed how-to on doing time-travel!
